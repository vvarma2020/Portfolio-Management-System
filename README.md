# Portfolio-Management-System

A course project completed in fulfillment of CS F214 Database Systems in sem II 2022-2023.

The Portfolio Management System is a well-designed database that can store and manage relevant data for the investorsâ€™ portfolios. The database stores information about investments, performance metrics, market data and other financial information. The database design has tables for investments, performance metrics, market data and other financial information.

The database design also includes various measures to ensure data consistency through primary keys, foreign keys and check constraints. Primary keys will be used to uniquely identify each record in the tables, while foreign keys will be used to establish relationships between the tables. Check constraints will be used to ensure that only valid data is stored in the database.
